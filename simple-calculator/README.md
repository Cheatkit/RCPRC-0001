This is a Java program that simulates a simple calculator. It allows the user to input two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), and then outputs the result of the calculation. The program also includes error handling for invalid inputs and operations, as well as a loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you will need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

After you have installed the JDK, you can compile and run the program using a command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the directory where the program is saved and enter the following commands:

```
javac SimpleCalculator.java
java SimpleCalculator
```

This will compile and run the program.

## How to Use

1. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the first number. Enter a number between 0 and 10 and press enter.

2. The program will then prompt you to enter an operator (+, -, *, /). Enter the operator you want to use and press enter.

3. Next, the program will prompt you to enter the second number. Enter a number between 0 and 10 and press enter.

4. The program will then output the result of the calculation.

5. The program will then ask if you want to perform another calculation. Enter 'J' or 'j' to continue or 'N' or 'n' to exit the program.

6. If you choose to continue, the program will loop back to step 1. If you choose to exit, the program will terminate.
