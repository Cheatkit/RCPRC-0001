# Grade Calculator Program - Swiss Grading System

This is a Java program that calculates the final grade of a student in a module by taking the input of grades of multiple courses. The program uses the GPA (Grade Point Average) system to calculate the student's overall performance in the module.

## How to Use

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a Java IDE or text editor (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code).
2. Copy the entire code of the program into a new Java file in the IDE.
3. Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g. `GradeCalculator.java`).
4. Compile the program to check for any errors in the code.
5. Run the program by executing the `main` method.
6. Follow the prompt to enter the grade for each course. If you want to stop entering grades, type "stop".
7. Once all grades are entered, the program will calculate the student's GPA and determine their letter grade and grade category.
8. The program will then print out the student's GPA, letter grade, and grade category.

## Program Features

- The program uses an `ArrayList` to store the grades of a student in multiple courses, and a `Scanner` to read input from the user.
- The program checks for invalid input and prompts the user to enter a numeric value or type "stop" to calculate the grade.
- The program calculates the student's GPA by calling a separate function that accepts an array of grades as a parameter.
- The program determines the letter grade and grade category based on the GPA calculated.
- The program prints out the student's GPA, letter grade, and grade category for the user to see.

## Conclusion

The Grade Calculator Program is a simple but effective tool for students to calculate their overall grade in a module. With its user-friendly interface and easy-to-follow steps, it is a useful program that can be used by students and teachers alike.
